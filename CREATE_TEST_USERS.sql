This application helps students by:
‚úÖ Answering questions about study materials
‚úÖ Creating personalized study schedules  
‚úÖ Providing explanations for complex topics
‚úÖ Tracking learning progress

Built with:
üêç Python for the AI backend
üß† TensorFlow for machine learning models
‚öõÔ∏è React for the frontend interface
üóÉÔ∏è PostgreSQL for data storage

The most challenging part was training the NLP model to understand various question formats. But seeing it help my classmates made all the effort worthwhile!

Currently working on adding voice interaction and mobile app support.
