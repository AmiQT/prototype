- Use consistent color palette: Primary Blue (#3B82F6), Secondary (#1D4ED8)
- Follow spacing system: 8px, 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### **Architecture Patterns**
- Continue using service layer pattern for business logic
- Implement Repository pattern for data access
- Use Provider for state management
- Separate UI components into reusable widgets
- Follow clean architecture principles
