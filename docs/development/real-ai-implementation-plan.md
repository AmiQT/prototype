    constructor() {
        this.gemini = new GeminiClient(apiKey);
        this.qwen3 = new QwenClient(apiKey);  
        this.deepseek = new DeepSeekClient(apiKey);
    }
    
    async processAdminCommand(command, context) {
        // Smart routing based on task type
        const taskType = this.identifyTaskType(command);
        
        switch(taskType) {
            case 'analytics':
                return await this.deepseek.analyze(command, context);
            case 'multilingual':
                return await this.qwen3.process(command, context);
            case 'creative':
                return await this.gemini.generate(command, context);
            default:
                return await this.qwen3.process(command, context); // Default
        }
    }
}
```

### **Fallback & Error Handling:**
```javascript
class AIFallbackSystem {
    async processWithFallback(command) {
        try {
            // Try primary AI
            return await this.primary.process(command);
        } catch (primaryError) {
            try {
                // Try secondary AI
                return await this.secondary.process(command);
            } catch (secondaryError) {
                // Fallback to template system
                return await this.templateSystem.process(command);
            }
        }
    }
