# CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

## 6.1 Conclusion

The Student Talent Profiling App has been successfully designed, developed, and tested as a comprehensive solution for managing student talents at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). This project aimed to address the challenge of effectively profiling, tracking, and analyzing student talents and achievements within the institution through the implementation of a dual-platform system comprising a mobile application for students and a web dashboard for administrators and lecturers.

The first objective was to design a student talent profiling app system using an object-oriented approach. This objective has been successfully achieved through comprehensive system analysis and design activities. The design phase incorporated object-oriented principles by defining clear class structures for core entities including Users, Profiles, Achievements, Events, Showcase Posts, Conversations, and Messages. Each class encapsulates its attributes and behaviors, promoting modularity and code reusability throughout the system. The Use Case Diagram identified nine primary use cases covering student authentication, profile management, achievement uploads, event participation, showcase posting, AI chat interaction, and administrative functions. Detailed Use Case Specifications defined the actors, preconditions, main flows, alternative flows, and exception handling for each use case. The Class Diagram established relationships between entities including associations and dependencies. The Entity Relationship Diagram modeled the database structure with proper primary keys, foreign keys, and cardinality constraints. Activity Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams illustrated the dynamic behavior of the system for key processes. The System Architecture design followed a three-tier architecture pattern separating presentation, business logic, and data access layers, ensuring the system is maintainable, extensible, and follows established software engineering best practices.

The second objective was to develop student talent profiling app systems using web-based and Android technology. This objective has been successfully achieved through the implementation of two distinct yet integrated platforms. The mobile application was developed using Flutter framework, which compiles to native Android code while providing a modern, responsive user interface. The Flutter implementation leverages the Provider pattern for state management, ensuring efficient data flow and UI updates throughout the application. Key mobile features include the Talent Hub login system, home dashboard with showcase feed, Discover screen for searching users and skills, comprehensive profile viewing and editing capabilities, event browsing with favorites and payment integration via ToyyibPay, showcase post creation and viewing, and the STAP UTHM Advisor AI chatbot for academic guidance powered by Google Gemini. The web-based dashboard was developed using Astro framework with TailwindCSS for styling, providing administrators and lecturers with powerful management tools. Dashboard features include secure admin authentication, analytics overview with KPI cards and interactive charts, user management with search and filtering capabilities, event management with participant tracking, AI Assistant powered by RAG technology, and PDF report generation. Both platforms connect to a unified Supabase backend providing PostgreSQL database services, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage capabilities. The FastAPI backend serves as an intermediary layer handling AI processing through LangChain and LangGraph frameworks.

The third objective was to test the developed system. This objective has been successfully achieved through comprehensive testing activities. The testing phase employed multiple testing methodologies to ensure system quality and reliability. Functional testing verified that all system features operate according to their specifications, including user authentication flows, profile CRUD operations, achievement upload and storage, event registration processes, showcase post creation and interaction, and AI chat functionality. Integration testing confirmed proper communication between system components including mobile app to backend API interactions, web dashboard to database connections, and AI agent tool execution. User Acceptance Testing was conducted to validate that the system meets user requirements and expectations, with test cases designed for each module covering User Authentication, Web Dashboard functionality, Mobile Application features, and AI & Analytics services. The testing process identified and resolved various issues, and the successful completion of all testing phases confirms that the developed system is ready for deployment and production use.

In conclusion, the Student Talent Profiling App successfully addresses the need for a comprehensive talent management solution in higher education. The integration of modern technologies including Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, Astro for web dashboard, Supabase for backend services, and Google Gemini for AI capabilities demonstrates the feasibility of implementing sophisticated technology solutions within educational contexts. The system provides students with tools to showcase their talents while equipping administrators with data-driven insights for better talent management and decision-making.

## 6.2 Future Work

While the current implementation of the Student Talent Profiling App successfully meets the established objectives, several enhancements are recommended for future development to further improve the system's capabilities and user experience.

In terms of technical enhancements, offline mode implementation using local database solutions such as Hive or SQLite would enable students to access their profiles and create draft content without requiring constant internet connectivity. Automated achievement verification through AI-powered Optical Character Recognition and certificate parsing would significantly reduce the manual verification workload for administrators while improving processing speed for students awaiting approval. Integration of push notification services via Firebase Cloud Messaging would enable real-time alerts for important events, messages from advisors, and profile update reminders, improving user engagement with the platform.

For feature enhancements, a mentor matching system could leverage AI algorithms to connect students with lecturers, industry professionals, or senior students based on compatible skills, interests, and career aspirations. Skills gap analysis implementing industry-aligned competency frameworks would help students identify areas for development and recommend relevant courses, workshops, or co-curricular activities to build their capabilities. Portfolio export functionality enabling generation of professional PDF documents or LinkedIn-compatible formats would support students in job applications and internship opportunities. Alumni integration extending the platform to include graduate networks would facilitate mentorship opportunities, professional networking, and career pathway guidance for current students.


These future enhancements would build upon the solid foundation established by the current implementation, further advancing the system's value as a comprehensive talent management solution for higher education institutions.
