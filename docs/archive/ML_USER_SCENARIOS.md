**Step 3: In Advising Meeting With Ali**

You: "Ali, how are things going?"
Ali: "Okay lah, just busy dengan assignments."

You: "I noticed you haven't attended many events. Boleh tahu why?"
Ali: "Yeah, nak focus on studies. Events macam waste of time."

You: "Actually, attending events beneficial jugak. Here's why:
      - Network dengan classmates (good for learning)
      - Break dari study (reduce stress)
      - Build soft skills (employers love this)
      The system shows you at 23% engagement - quite low for your level."

Ali: "Hmm, didn't think of it that way."

You: "How about this - try 1 event next month? 
      See if it helps atau make things worse?
      We'll check in after."

Ali: "Okay, I'll try."

You: "Great! Also noticed profile 60% complete. 
      Can you add photo, skills, interests?
      Might help dengan opportunities."

Ali: "I'll do that this week."

You: "Perfect! Let's catch up in 3 weeks, see how things going?"

            tapi haven't talked to her yet."

You: "Good catch. ML flagged her low engagement + declining activity.
     You could ask her directly - maybe personal issue?"

Counselor: "I can schedule her if needed. What does system recommend?"

You: "Mentoring + understanding root cause. 
     Once we know issue, can address properly."

Lecturer 2: "What about Nurul? 55% risk - seems manageable?"
