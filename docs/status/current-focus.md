## 🏗️ **FINAL ARCHITECTURE (Confirmed)**

### **✅ What We're KEEPING:**
- **Cloudinary** untuk media storage (working perfectly)
- **Supabase Direct** untuk mobile users & web admin (fast & efficient)
- **Custom FastAPI Backend** reserved for data mining only
- **Current working patterns** yang users dah familiar

### **✅ What We FIXED:**
- ✅ Like UI stuck issue - now syncs immediately with database
- ✅ Comment username resolution - proper names instead of "User"
- ✅ Mobile app performance optimized
- ✅ User experience smooth and reliable

### **🎯 Current Architecture Division:**
- **Mobile App (Users)** → Supabase Direct (auth, posts, comments, likes)
- **Web Dashboard (Admin)** → Supabase Direct (user management, events, CRUD)  
- **Custom Backend** → Data Mining Only (analytics, ML algorithms)
