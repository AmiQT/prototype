1 CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1  Project Background 
Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) is a public Malaysian university 
that focused on engineering field and vocational training (TVET) with along general  
course of management business and computer science.  The campus is filled with 
talented student and always encourage development and skills for student throughout 
competition, events and program industry- ready skills. Fakulti Sains Komputer dan 
Teknologi Maklumat (FSKTM) is main faculty focused for computer science student 
and keep being represent UTHM in competition related with software technology. One 
of main goals UTHM is to prepare students for industry challenges with program 
development talent.  
 Until now, the management of faculty still using manual data management to 
manage the data of talented students from FSKTM via office room through local 
computer machine  and paper documentation. The data of student s is collected via 
paper forms filled by students and lecturers. The access to data is l imited because of 
record kept in office, only accessible during office hours. Lastly only office admin has 
permission to access the data for recording or analysing it.  
The problem of this process is that it limits the accessible of records due to 
physical a ccess during office hours in the office. The collected data also may be 
insufficient and inefficient becau se of lack student filling their  data manually. This 
lead to dependence on lecturer to gather and collect data of talented students.  
The solution proposed for these issues  is to build and develop St udent Talent 
Profiling App, wh ich will in volve users from st udents, lecturers and administrators. 
The application can help students to register and create their own profile talent wh ile 
keep updating it from mobile phone. The feature offered such submit achievements, 
tag skills and talent in r eal-time. For lectu rers, they can insight and view talented 
students to recruit them in any competition and campaign. Administrator will manage 
data remotely through dashboards website with function like analyse data and generate 
report. 
1.2  Problem statement  
The problem with current issues is reliance on traditional methods. The usage 
of paper-based documents and local digital storage on local machine computers will 
make the data unsharred and access online among the staff, lead to bottlenecks 
during urgent tasks. This limit access the data because local machines are specified 
to store the data.  
Time is constrained because office hours dependency only allows the staff to 
access the data during office hours, it is inflexible for staff and lecturers to submit 
new data of students outside the office hours. 
Inefficient collection of data since it only reliance on lecturers to identify and 
search for talented students among their students themselves. Manual paper forms 
provided by the office is unattractive for students to fill and not effective since the 
students prefer digital engagement. 
1.3  Objective 
The objectives of this system are to: 
1. To design a student talent profiling app system using object-oriented approach. 
2. To develop student talent profiling app systems using web- based and android 
technology. 
3. To test the developed system. 
 
1.4  Scope 
The student talent profiling app is based on educational technology domain, this 
study domain focused on development and implementation of digital platforms in web-
based and android technologies to create and manage student talent profile. The 
domain will enhance student development and educational assessment to create 
student with capabilities of surviving after graduation. It also uses data management 
and data mining to create and manage the student data with systematic, effective and 
efficient.  
 
The case study is located on faculty of FSKTM in UTHM Parit Raja, Johor with 
the staff of faculty assistance to help guiding the process of managing student record 
and data.  
 
Students, lecturers and office administrators are involved in this process. The 
students are the main target because of their data and record since this app is collecting 
their data, processing and storing it for office usage. For lecturers, they can insight 
their own student talent such data of performance, record of skills and activities the 
student have joined. The office administrator will manage all the process and data 
record of student for analysis and help make decisions for student development 
planning in the future. 
 
The user list is student, lecturer and office administrator, where the student can 
fill their own data into the app, lecturer can view and insight their student profile and 
lastly office administrator can generate reports, manage records and analysis the data 
for better decision making. 
 
The function system of this app is student profile management. The students can 
create their own profile, update it from time to time to ensure that the data is latest and 
updated. Talent category management will allow users to define and categorize the 
talents the student record has . Achievement management can add any certification 
students have and link it with official proof of certification. Reporting and analytics 
will generate student reports based on their achievement and talent listed. Data 
management can secure data storage and retrieval with cloud storage. 
1.5  Expected result. 
The expected outcome of this student talent profiling app is to make students 
aware of their talent and opportunities UTHM can provide to them. This also can 
enhance student motivation to develop more talents and skills for themselves. For 
lecturers, they can identify and view talented students in the faculty with better 
experience. They also can guide the talented students to achieve new talent and skills 
in the future. Office administration can record all talented student data for reference in 
the future. 
1.6  Project Significance 
The advantages of this project include students filling in their own data to the 
management for better planning and actions to be taken in the future while studying 
normally. The capability to fill their own data by using the app will improve the user 
experience and awareness of these data as students before graduation. The lecturer can 
view and search for any talented students to guide them in getting new talents or 
competition. The administrator can generate reports and use it for decision-making.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
2.1  Introduction 
This chapter is presenting the review of any existing system that already exists in 
literature from reputable publisher and relate it with the development of this project, 
Student Talent Profiling App for comparison and improvement from the existed 
system. It focuses on domain case study, method of technology that used for 
developing the system, and study of existing related systems. The purpose of this 
chapter is to provide theoretical background and justification for the proposed system 
by analysing the s ystem, identifying any gaps, and explaining how the project will 
contribute to solving the real-world problems in real case. 
 The structure of the chapter will include description of current situation system 
used in FSKTM, UTHM and followed by discussion on the method technology in 
developing the new system. Three existing related system are analyzed, compared to 
and evaluated. Lastly, the proposed system is described in detail, and its features are 
compared with the existing systems. 
  
2.2  Domain Case Study  
Fakulti Sains Komputer dan Teknologi Maklumat (FSKTM) at Universiti Tun Hussein 
Onn Malaysia (UTHM) playing a vital role in produce quality skilled graduates’  
student in computer science and technology. However, the current process of 
managing student talents relies heavily on manual data collection through google 
forms and local digital storage in office computers. 
 According to the project background, only administrative staff have access to 
updating and analyzing the data, leading to inefficiencies and limitations of access 
during outside office hours. This problem highlighted the need for a centralized, 
digitized, and accessible system that allows students to create and manage their own 
profiles, achievement and enabling the lecturer to view and analyze talent-related data 
efficiently. 
 A digital platform like the Student Talent Profiling App will streamline this 
process by allowing real-time updates, cloud-based data storage and user-based access 
control. This will address the limitations of the current system by providing dynamic, 
flexible, and interactive approaches to managing student talents. 
  
2.3  Method and Technology 
2.3.1 Mobile App System 
For the mobile app development, Flutter is used as the primary framework. Flutter is 
a powerful, open- source framework by Google that allows for the development of 
high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications for both Android and iOS. The 
use of Flutter ensures that the mobile app runs seamlessly on both platforms, offering 
a consistent user experience across devices. 
Just like the web-based system, the mobile app is connected to Firebase, which serves 
as the backend for real-time data storage and authentication. The app allows students 
to create and manage their talent profiles, showcase achievements, and track progress. 
The connection with Firebase ensures that all data entered in the mo bile app is 
synchronized with the web- based system, providing administrators with real -time 
updates. 
The mobile app also integrates various functionalities, including notifications, to alert 
students when there are updates or changes to their profiles or achievements. This 
enhances the app's interactivity and engagement, allowing students to stay up to date 
with their career development. 
2.3.2 Web-based System 
The web-based component of the Student Talent Profiling App serves as the Admin 
Dashboard. The dashboard allows administrators to manage student profiles, generate 
reports, and analyze data. For the front -end development, we use a combination of 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies are essential for building the user 
interface (UI), providing an interactive and responsive experience for the 
administrators. 
The front -end is connected to Firebase, which serves as the backend to store and 
manage the data. Firebase is used for real -time data synchronization, authentication, 
and database management. It allows for secure and efficient data handling, ensuring 
that all student profiles and credentials are stored and accessed securely. Additionally, 
Firebase integrates seamlessly with JavaScript, enabling dynamic updates to the 
dashboard without needing to refresh the page. 
The data mining functionality is an integral part of the web-based system. It is used to 
generate reports and analytics on student performance, skills, and achievements. By 
leveraging Firebase’s real-time database, the system can quickly process and analyze 
student data to generate insights. These reports can help adminis trators and faculty 
members track the progress of students, identify trends, and make informed decisions 
about student development and career planning. 
2.3.3 Object-Oriented Approach (OOA) 
The Object-Oriented Approach (OOA) plays a crucial role in the design of the Student 
Talent Profiling App. This software development methodology is focused on 
organizing the system around objects rather than functions and logic. Objects represent 
entities within the system, such as students, admin, achievements, and skills, each with 
attributes and behaviours. 
In this system, each entity, such as a student, has a corresponding class that 
contains attributes like name, email, achievements, and methods for updating and 
managing the data. Similarly, other entities such as Achievements or Skills are 
modelled as classes that can store data and allow for easy retrieval, modification, and 
interaction. 
OOA allows for better modularity and reusability in the system, making it 
easier to manage the development and maintenance of the application. Each module 
of the app is treated as a separate object, allowing the development team to focus on 
specific parts of the system without affecting other components. This modularity also 
facilitates easier debugging, testing, and scaling of the system over time. 
Since OOA is a methodology that guides the software design rather than a specific 
technology, it fits within the System  Design section of the report, where you will 
explain how the system was organized and structured. This methodology allows for 
clear separation of responsibilities, smooth data flow, and the ability to easily extend 
the system with new features. 
  
2.4  Study of Existing Related Systems

4.3 System Analysis 
System design describes the overall structure or flow of the system , including its 
function. Indirectly, it will reduce the gap between the needs and the proposed system. 
It also transfers the proposed system functionality into the graphical diagram according 
to specific requirements. In this section, the proposed system design is described. 
Object-oriented approach is used to generate the UML diagrams, which are Use Case 
Diagram, Activity Diagram, Sequence Diagram and Class Diagram. 
4.3.1 Use Case Diagram 
Figure 4.3 shows the use case diagram that represents the overall activity using the 
student talent profiling app, where the interaction actor and the system functionalities 
are depicted. The main actor includes students, lecturers, and administrators. This 
diagram represents the main tasks of each actor can perform based on module listed.

The following are the interfaces wireframe that have been designed based on each process in 
Figure 4.2. The wireframe is designed using Figma software.  
 
 
4.3.3.1 Login the app Interfaces 
 
This is the wireframe interface for login module, where students will fill in their information 
using SMAP to login to the system. If the account is valid, then they will bring it to the 
dashboard for normal users but for new users, they will bring it to t he registration section to 
create their own profile.  

 
 
Figure 4.3.3.2: Profile Management Interfaces 
 
For the second module, which is profile management, the page will show user information 
including experience, project etc. It also shows the status of student performance to monitor 
based on grade and curriculum activities for students to balance it. 

 
Figure 4.3.3.3: Achievement and Event Program Interface 
 
For the third module, achievement also can be seen from profile interface for quick view. For 
any student that wants to look for new achievement or volunteering in any events and program, 
they can explore any events UTHM currently has in the campus for students. Figure 4.3.3.3 
shows example of events and programs faculty held to look for student participation.  
 
Figure 4.3.3.4: Web Admin Dashboard Interfaces 

For the next module, reporting and analytic interfaces are available on desktop versions since 
it use web version for better experience due to ratio aspect and screen size. The web shows 
the main dashboard for admin to quicken view all data available from students. There is quick 
navigation for admin to navigate to other page for reporting and access full graph for full 
reporting.
